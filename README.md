# Flickr Gallery

Welcome to the Flickr Gallery application.
This app is simple, you write a tag at the top and you get images from flickr with that tag.

### Task 1 - Image Actions
Each image has three buttons that appear on mouse hover.
1. Delete: clicking the delete button remove the image from the display. 
2. Rotate: each click rotate the image by 90 degrees.
3. Expand: clicking an image should display this image in a larger view. 

### Task 2 - Gallery Actions
1. Responsive:  the gallery adjusts the size of each image so that all the images will fit into the screen without margin.
2. Infinite Scroll: A mechanism that loads more images from flickr when the user is scrolling past the last image. 
3. Drag & Drop: let the users choose the order of the images by adding an option to drag & drop images to their new position.
